# Cobra
2D shoot them up
Cobra is a 2D space game with vertical scrolling (also called shmups), written exclusively in python 3.6 (using pygame) and playable with PS3 controller and/or keyboard. 
The project is under active development (no GUI available right now), but the coding is going pretty smoothly and I hope to deliver a solid engine within a few months with a couple playable levels.

DEMO AVAILABLE 
- Download the project (including Assets directory) and double click ont he batch file Cobra.exe.10485760.combine.bat.
- Run Cobra.exe
